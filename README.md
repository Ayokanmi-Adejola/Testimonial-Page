## Overview
This project is a responsive testimonial page built as part of the devChallenges.io Testimonial Page challenge. The goal was to replicate a provided design as closely as possible using only HTML and CSS. The page features a clean, modern layout with a left-aligned checklist and staggered testimonial cards for Google and Meta, matching the reference design.
